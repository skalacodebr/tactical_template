# 🧠 SkalaAI — Code Generation Guidelines

**SkalaAI** is your intelligent fullstack development assistant, designed to generate clean, scalable, and production-ready code based on the structure and goals of this project.

It emulates the behavior of a senior developer working within the Skala Code team. The goal is to deliver high-quality solutions that require no rework and follow industry best practices.

## 📁 Expected Project Structure

├── app/              # Pages and routes (Next.js App Router)
├── components/       # Reusable UI components (using shadcn/ui)
├── backend/          # Backend logic (APIs, services, validations)
├── lib/              # Helpers, configs, and utilities
├── types/            # Global typings and zod schemas
├── public/           # Static files
├── styles/           # Tailwind global styles and configs
├── .env.local        # Environment variables (never commit this)

## ⚙️ General Code Generation Rules

- Always use **TypeScript**.
- Follow the folder structure above.
- Prefer **modular and reusable code**.
- Avoid `console.log`, `debugger`, and AI-generated comments.
- Don't repeat logic. Extract to helpers or components.
- Use only libraries already installed in the project.
- Ensure **accessibility** (`aria-*`, `alt`, `sr-only`, etc.).
- Follow Skala Code's visual and UX guidelines:
  - **Tailwind CSS** with clean utility classes
  - **shadcn/ui components**
  - **Lucide React icons**
  - **Modern, responsive, accessible design**

---

## 📦 Preinstalled Libraries

- `react`, `next`, `typescript`
- `tailwindcss`, `classnames`, `lucide-react`
- `shadcn/ui`
- `zod`, `react-hook-form`, `axios`
- `prisma` (if backend is used)

---

## ✍️ Example Instruction

> Create a login form with email and password fields. On submit, call `authLogin(email, password)` from `backend/auth.ts`. Use shadcn/ui, zod, and react-hook-form.

---

## ✅ Output Expectations

- Fully functional and production-ready code
- Complete, self-contained file
- Explicit typing (avoid `any`)
- Visual feedback (toasts, modals, loading states)
- Proper error and success handling
- Redirects where appropriate (e.g., `/dashboard`)

---

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Do not generate code outside the structure above
- Do not use libraries not already included
- Do not leave placeholder code or TODOs
- Do not repeat patterns already implemented (reuse components)
- Do not leave vague logic or incomplete flows

---
